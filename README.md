# AI-Tournaments
AI Tournaments is still in an early prototype stage. See the section on [`Participate`](#Participate) if you want to join a arena, then analyze how other have solved the arena until better documentation has been written. The name of the repository will be the name used in the arena, except if it starts with `AI-Tournaments-Participant-` then that part is removed.

## Participate
To participate in a Arena you need to create a GitHub repository and add three topics: `AI-Tournaments`, `Participant` and the name of the arena. The created repository has to have a file in root called `participant.js`, this is the file that will be called to the arena.

## Why open source?
// TODO: Write about execution of user written JavaScript and security (IFrame and Web Worker).
### Arenas
Fair insight.
