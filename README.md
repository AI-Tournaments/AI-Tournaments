# AI-Tournaments
AI Tournaments (.io) is still in an early prototype stage. If you want to participate, make a Fork of a `[ARENA]-AI-Tournament-Participant` repository (this will probably be (breaking) changed in the future) and analyze how other forks have solved the arena until better documentation has been written.

## Participate
To participate in a Arena you need to create a GitHub repository and add two topics. `AI-Tournament-Participant` and the name of the arena. The created repository has to have a file in root called `participant.js`, this is the file that will be called to the arena.

## Why open source?
// TODO: Write about execution of user written JavaScript and security (IFrame and Web Worker).
### Arenas
Fair insight.
